# Plan of the analysis

## Stage 1 — published tools and parameters (justifies stage 2)

For the nine appendicularian genomes:
- Selenoprofiles 4.5.8 with the default metazoan profiles; Secmarker for tRNA-Sec.
- Generic protein survey: miniprot alignments of profile sequences, Sec codon = in-frame TGA matching the reference
  Sec context.
- SECIS: Rfam RF00031 (Infernal) on 3′ regions of the Sec genes.
- Public annotations of the three *O. dioica* assemblies compared with the Sec codons (Ticó et al. 2026 classes).
- Transcript evidence: OKI2018 transcriptome, OSKA2016 transcripts, OdB3 ESTs (splice-aware alignment; Sec codon in
  an exon; screens for Sec-extended and C-terminal Sec reading frames with a SECIS).
Outputs that justify stage 2: genes missed by every tool; RF00031 sensitivity on appendicularian 3′ regions;
annotation error classes.

## Curation — baseline from the three *O. dioica* assemblies

Tables in `curation/`: one row per Sec gene and assembly, with the Sec codon, the evidence (tool, transcript, cross-
assembly comparison) and notes on assembly errors (recorded, not fixed).

## Stage 2 — final parameters (delivers the results)

- *Oikopleura* SECIS model built from baseline 3′ regions (Oikopleuridae seeds, OSKA2016 held out as control);
  held-out, shuffled, non-target (other tunicates) and covariation tests; threshold choice.
- Lineage reference proteins (curated *O. dioica* sequences) and profile HMMs for genes missed in stage 1
  (SELENOK, PSTK), each tested with the target genome left out.
- Re-calling on the nine genomes with the final parameters; census per genome; machinery; Cys homologs.
- Operons in the three *O. dioica* assemblies (collinear genes at most 500 nt apart; Plessy et al. 2024).
